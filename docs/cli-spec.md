# n8n-cli Spec

This document describes the current `0.1.x` shape of `n8nc`.

It is intentionally narrower than the original brainstorm. The tool is now specified as a same-instance workflow sync and development CLI, not as a multi-environment deployment system.

## 1. Product Boundary

`n8nc` is for:

- listing workflows from a configured n8n instance
- listing recent executions and fetching one execution by ID
- fetching one workflow into a canonical local artifact
- validating and formatting local workflow files
- pushing a tracked workflow back safely
- activating and deactivating workflows
- calling webhook trigger URLs during development

`n8nc` is not yet for:

- promoting a workflow across multiple environments
- remapping credential IDs or project bindings between instances
- creating a new workflow from a local file
- generic execution control through undocumented or unverified endpoints

## 2. Command Surface

Top-level commands:

```text
n8nc
├── init
├── auth add
├── auth test
├── auth list
├── auth remove
├── ls
├── get
├── runs ls
├── runs get
├── pull
├── push
├── status
├── diff
├── activate
├── deactivate
├── trigger
├── fmt
└── validate
```

## 3. Repository Model

`init` creates:

```text
.
├── n8n.toml
├── workflows/
└── .n8n/
    └── cache/
```

`n8n.toml` stores:

- `schema_version`
- `default_instance`
- `workflow_dir`
- instance aliases and base URLs

Example:

```toml
schema_version = 1
default_instance = "prod"
workflow_dir = "workflows"

[instances.prod]
base_url = "https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud"
api_version = "v1"
```

Tracked files:

```text
workflows/<slug>--<workflow_id>.workflow.json
workflows/<slug>--<workflow_id>.meta.json
```

The path is intentionally environment-neutral, but the sidecar binds the file to the instance it came from. That keeps the Git history of a single instance clean while making the current scope explicit.

The cache stores one canonical base snapshot per tracked workflow:

```text
.n8n/cache/<instance>--<workflow_id>.workflow.json
```

That snapshot is refreshed on `pull` and successful `push`.

## 4. Credentials

Credentials are resolved in this order:

1. `N8NC_TOKEN_<ALIAS>`
2. OS keychain entry stored by `auth add`

Example:

- `N8NC_TOKEN_PROD`
- `N8NC_TOKEN_STAGING`

`auth add` is non-interactive in v0.1. You must provide `--token` or `--stdin`.

## 5. API Assumptions

The implementation targets the public n8n API with:

- header: `X-N8N-API-KEY`
- default base path: `/api/v1`

The CLI currently assumes these workflow endpoints exist and are reachable through the public API:

- `GET /workflows`
- `GET /workflows/{id}`
- `PUT /workflows/{id}`
- `POST /workflows/{id}/activate`
- `POST /workflows/{id}/deactivate`

The execution commands currently assume these endpoints exist and are reachable through the public API:

- `GET /executions`
- `GET /executions/{id}`

`runs get --details` uses `includeData=true` when fetching a single execution.

`trigger` does not use the public API. It makes a direct HTTP request to a full URL or a path resolved against the configured instance base URL.

## 6. Canonical Workflow Artifact

Tracked workflow files are canonical JSON.

Current canonicalization rules:

- top-level payload must be a JSON object
- top-level volatile fields are removed:
  - `createdAt`
  - `updatedAt`
  - `versionId`
- top-level keys are emitted in this order when present:
  - `id`
  - `name`
  - `active`
  - `tags`
  - `settings`
  - `nodes`
  - `connections`
- nested object keys are sorted
- array order is preserved
- output is pretty JSON with 2-space indentation and trailing newline

This canonicalization is versioned.

Current values:

- `canonical_version = 1`
- `hash_algorithm = "sha256"`

## 7. Metadata Sidecar

Each pulled workflow has a committed sidecar:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "canonical_version": 1,
  "hash_algorithm": "sha256",
  "instance": "prod",
  "workflow_id": "abc123",
  "local_relpath": "workflows/order-alert--abc123.workflow.json",
  "pulled_at": "2026-03-26T10:31:54Z",
  "remote_updated_at": "2026-03-26T10:30:10Z",
  "remote_hash": "sha256:..."
}
```

The important field is `remote_hash`. It is the lease token used by `push`.

## 8. Status Model

`status` is local by default in `0.1.x`.

Base local states:

- `clean`: workflow file and sidecar are valid, and the local canonical hash matches the recorded `remote_hash`
- `modified`: workflow file and sidecar are valid, and the local canonical hash differs from the recorded `remote_hash`
- `untracked`: workflow file exists without a sidecar
- `invalid`: workflow file or sidecar cannot be used safely
- `orphaned_meta`: sidecar exists without a matching workflow file

`invalid` currently covers cases like:

- workflow JSON parse failure
- sidecar parse failure
- metadata `workflow_id` mismatch
- unsupported `canonical_version`
- unsupported `hash_algorithm`
- validation errors such as missing node targets

`status --refresh` adds live remote sync classification for entries that are already `clean` or `modified`.

Remote sync states:

- `clean`: local file still matches the remote lease recorded in the sidecar
- `modified`: local file changed, but the remote still matches the recorded lease
- `drifted`: local file is unchanged, but the remote no longer matches the recorded lease
- `conflict`: both local file and remote changed since the last pull or successful push
- `missing_remote`: the tracked workflow no longer exists remotely

Entries that cannot be refreshed, such as `untracked`, `invalid`, or `orphaned_meta`, remain visible with their local state and count toward the refresh summary as `unavailable`.

## 9. Push Safety Model

`push` is update-only in `0.1.x`.

Algorithm:

1. Read the local workflow file.
2. Canonicalize it and hash it.
3. Read the sidecar.
4. Fetch the current remote workflow by ID.
5. Canonicalize the remote payload and hash it.
6. Compare remote hash to `meta.remote_hash`.

Outcomes:

- if `remote_hash != meta.remote_hash`, refuse the push with exit code `12`
- if `local_hash == meta.remote_hash`, report no-op
- otherwise, update the workflow with `PUT /workflows/{id}`

After a successful push, the CLI re-writes the workflow and sidecar from the server response so local state stays canonical.

## 10. Diff Model

`diff` is local by default in `0.1.x`.

It compares:

- the current canonical local workflow file
- the cached base snapshot from `.n8n/cache`

If a cache snapshot is unavailable, `diff` falls back to hash and state reporting only and tells the user to re-pull the workflow to seed local diff data.

The human output includes:

- status summary
- file path
- workflow ID
- local, recorded, and base hashes when available
- changed top-level sections
- unified patch when a base snapshot exists and content changed

The JSON output includes:

- the local status object
- `base_hash`
- `base_snapshot_available`
- `changed_sections`
- optional `patch`

`diff --refresh` keeps the base snapshot comparison and also fetches the current remote workflow by ID.

Additional human output in refresh mode:

- remote sync state
- remote hash
- remote update timestamp when present
- changed top-level sections between the current remote workflow and the local file
- unified `remote` vs `local` patch when both sides are available and differ

Additional JSON fields in refresh mode:

- `status.sync_state`
- `status.remote_hash`
- `status.remote_updated_at`
- `status.remote_detail`
- `remote_comparison_available`
- `remote_changed_sections`
- optional `remote_patch`

## 11. Validation

`validate` currently checks:

- file parses as JSON
- workflow payload is an object
- `id` exists
- `nodes` is an array
- `connections` is an object
- node names are unique
- connection targets point to existing node names
- if a sidecar exists, `workflow_id` matches the workflow file

## 12. Execution Inspection

`runs ls` returns recent executions from the remote instance.

Current supported options:

- `--limit`
- `--workflow <id-or-exact-name>`
- `--status <value>`

List rows currently include:

- execution ID
- workflow ID
- workflow name when it can be resolved
- status
- mode
- started and stopped timestamps
- computed duration in milliseconds when both timestamps exist

`runs get <execution-id>` returns the execution summary.

`runs get <execution-id> --details` fetches the detailed execution payload and, in human output, summarizes:

- workflow name and ID
- status and mode
- start and stop timestamps
- computed duration
- node-level execution status
- node execution time
- output item counts per node based on `data.resultData.runData`

The current diagnostics model is intentionally simple:

- `severity`
- `code`
- `message`
- `file`
- optional JSON path
- optional suggestion

## 12. Triggering

The user concern that started this implementation was valid: developers need more than `pull` and `push`.

The current answer is:

- use `ls` and `get` for fast inspection
- use `activate` and `deactivate` for workflow state changes
- use `trigger` for webhook-based development flows

`trigger` supports:

- full URLs
- instance-relative paths
- custom method
- repeated `--header key:value`
- repeated `--query key=value`
- request body from `--data`, `--data-file`, or `--stdin`

This avoids pretending there is a stable public “run workflow by ID” endpoint when that has not been verified in the implementation.

## 13. JSON Contract

Every command supports `--json`.

Success envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "ls",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "contract_version": 1,
  "data": {}
}
```

Error envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "command": "push",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "contract_version": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": "conflict.remote_changed",
    "message": "Remote workflow changed since the last pull."
  }
}
```

Validation failures may also include a `data` object with diagnostics.

## 14. Exit Codes

- `0`: success
- `2`: usage error
- `3`: config error
- `4`: auth error
- `5`: network error
- `6`: API error
- `10`: validation error
- `11`: not found
- `12`: conflict refusal

## 15. Known Limits

- The tool is currently strongest when a repo mirrors one n8n instance.
- `tags` are preserved structurally, not normalized semantically.
- `ls` assumes a paginated workflow list response with `data` and optional `nextCursor`.
- `status` and `diff` are local-only and do not verify remote drift.
- `diff` is best after a fresh `pull`, because older repos may not have cached base snapshots yet.

## 16. Next Likely Steps

The next improvements that fit the current design are:

1. remote-aware `status --refresh`
2. remote-aware `diff --refresh`
3. create workflow from local file
4. richer execution inspection if public endpoints are verified
5. only after that: a real environment-promotion model with explicit mappings and lock files
